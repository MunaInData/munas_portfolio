With a background as a Finance Analyst, I have transitioned into Data Analytics to leverage my analytical skills in a more data-driven role. I have gained expertise in MySQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, enabling me to extract insights and create impactful visualisations. Currently, I am enhancing my skills through a Data Technician Bootcamp, where I am deepening my knowledge in data processing, analysis, and visualisation. Passionate about using data to drive strategic decisions, I am eager to apply my expertise in a dynamic data role.

  ### GDP (nominal) per Capita <a name="gdp-nominal"></a> 
    
  This file allowed me to explore countries IMF estimates, World Bank estimates and UN estimates. Using Python I was able to investigate important information. 

  
  <img src="Images/Image 1.png" alt="Image 1" width="400" height="200">

  
  Image 1 shows me integrating my data as you can see I was looking at the amount of countries per continents. There is slight misinformation as on google Africa has 54, 
  Asia has 48, Europe has 44, North America has 23, South America has 12, and Oceania has 14. There is increase number of countries in my data which were incorrect. 
  

  <img src="Images/Image 2.png" alt="Image 2" width="450" height="300">

  Image 2 shows countries which are below the IMF estimates, I had to clean my data before this as a lot of IMF estimate were coming up as NaN which stands for not a 
  number. I replaced this with the value of 0 to get more precision.

  ### Students <a name="Studentsin.csv"></a> 

Students file contained id, name, class, marks and gender of students. Here I was able to use python syntax to obtain wanted information.  

 <img src="Images/Image 3.png" alt="Image 3" width="450" height="300">

Image 3 I was able to check which students were in class four. Because I didn‚Äôt specify which columns I wanted only on display I was given all their information such as ID, mark, name and gender. 

 <img src="Images/Image 4.png" alt="Image 4" width="450" height="300">

Image 4 I was able assign a new column named ‚Äòpassed‚Äô where any student who obtained a mark over 60 will show true or under 60 will show false. 

 <img src="Images/Image 5 .png" alt="Image 5" width="450" height="300">
 

Image 5  shows how easy it is to rename a column. I was able to replace column name ‚Äòmark‚Äô with ‚Äòscore‚Äô which makes it easier to read.

### World_db <a name="World_db"></a> 

I was able to use a world database to retrieve information regarding population, GDP and city names. I used SQL syntax to get my wanted outcome.  

Question 1 : Cities with High GDP per Capita: Scenario: An economic consulting firm is analysing cities with high GDP per capita for investment opportunities. You're tasked with identifying cities with above-average GDP per capita from the database to assist the firm in identifying potential investment destinations. 

<img src="Images/Image 6.png" alt="Image 6" width="450" height="300">

Question 2 : Cities in Europe: Scenario: A European cultural exchange program is seeking to connect students with cities across the continent. You're tasked with compiling a list of cities located in Europe from the database to facilitate program planning and student engagement. 

<img src="Images/Image 7.png" alt="Image 7" width="450" height="300">

Question 3: Country with Largest Population: Scenario: A global economic research institute requires data on countries with the largest populations for a comprehensive analysis. You're tasked with identifying the country with the highest population from the database to provide valuable insights into demographic trends.

  ### WHO Health Survey <a name="who-health"></a> 


   # Overview:  

Using the Health data set, I conducted an analysis to find trends and key information that could be used by government agencies for future support. This will be critical for future decisions regarding public health.  

 # Process: 

I used Tableau for visualisation to understand relationships quickly.

<img src="Images/Image 9.png" alt="Image 9" width="450" height="550">

The above shows the relationship between genders and life expectancy. Women on average live less than men. This goes on to ask questions such as whether childbirth or menstruation could be a leading factor.

<img src="Images/Image 10.png" alt="Image 10" width="450" height="550">

I also had to do a quick check the population sample and gender. There I can see there is more men used then women which could determine the difference relating to genders. 

<img src="Images/Image 11.png" alt="Image 11" width="450" height="550">

I wanted to explore if stomach cancer had a relationship with time as we have changed the way we eat. With the new food being brought out each year (different snacks or fast food chains). As you can see above stomach cancer has been increasing and we could ask whether we should explore our diets.

  ### Bike Sales <a name="bike-sales"></a> 

   ## Overview:  

The bicycle sales company wants to determine the purchasing patterns of different demographic groups to identify areas where it needs to concentrate its marketing efforts. The company also wants to see if there are purchasing differences between the countries where it operates.

  ## Process: 

  <img src="Images/Image 12.png" alt="Image 12" width="800" height="100">

  Using a Pivot table can be useful, for information in records or data that could be missed in first sight by summarising and re-presenting the data we can pick up on trends. Above shows countries as columns with 
  sales totals for each age group and each country.

 # Visualising Pivot Table Data: 

Presenting the pivot table as a graphical chart will highlight features of the data and assist in analysis and decision making. 

<img src="Images/Image 13.png" alt="Image 13" width="500" height="300">

Above graphically shows that the youth age group is globally the poorest area of sales. Female adults are buying the most product. 

 ### AIRBNB <a name="bike-sales"></a> 

  ## Overview:  

This dataset was interesting as it was a list of Air Bnb customers and their reviews regarding their stays. I wanted to explore if this data can show me correlations. This would be brilliant data information for Air Bnb host to understand customers better and spot behaviour patterns. 

 ## Process: 

Pivot Table and Visualisations: 

Once again, I used a pivot table to  explore information.  

<img src="Images/Image 14.png" alt="Image 14" width="700" height="250">

I then converted this into a Pie chart as this can look at proportions the best.  

<img src="Images/Image 15.png" alt="Image 15" width="500" height="450">

Here I wanted to see whether the room type had an impact on the number of reviews received. As you can see customers feel the need to leave a review when they get an entire home/apartment. This may be also due to financial reasons too as they would be paying more.  

Scatter plot can show relationships.

<img src="Images/Image 16.png" alt="Image 16" width="500" height="450">

The above scatter plot diagram was a hard read so I used a formula below to see if there was an actual relationship. As you know -1 and 1 lets you know that there is a relationship, however, anything between can mean less of a strong relationship. My correlation was 0.04 which concludes that the price does not really determine the number of nights stayed.  
Formula:
CORREL(column 1:column 1, column 2: column 2)

  ### AdventureWorks <a name="adventureworks"></a>

   ## Overview:  

   I was provided information of profits, sales, cost, orders, targets. With information like this I was able to use create visual calculations and create dashboards.  

   ## Process:

   Visual Calculation

   <img src="Images/Image 18.png" alt="Image 18" width="600" height="450">

   Above shows a visual calculation. Here I used ‚ÄòClustered Bar Chart‚Äô where I was looking the total of sales and cost. From this I was able to use ‚ÄòVisual Calculation‚Äô to calculate profit. Then I used suggested calculation which is based on Microsoft Copilot AI. I used the following:  
 - Versus Previous compares a value to a preceding value, so we see the Profit compared to the previous value for Year.
 - Running sum calculates the sum of values, adding the current value to the preceding values, so we see the total of current and previous years.
 - Moving average calculates an average of a set of values in a given window by dividing the sum of the values by the size of the window. By setting the window size to 2, we are calculating the average of two consecutive values. In this example, the values are yearly profits, so we see the moving average for FY2019 is the average of the profits for FY2018 and FY2019.

  
  
  Dashboards 



   <img src="Images/Image 19.png" alt="Image 19" width="600" height="500">

Having a dashboard is useful for many reasons such as displaying key metrics and trends in one page. This makes it easier to compare insights without switching pages. Having key slicers such as region and year makes it easier to retrieve information quicker. Here I‚Äôm able to look at category and see sales and margin within a selected year or compare regions.
