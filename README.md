Data Analyst
------------

With a background as a Finance Analyst, I have transitioned into Data Analytics to leverage my analytical skills in a more data-driven role. I have gained expertise in MySQL, Python (Google Colab), Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, enabling me to extract insights and create impactful visualisations. Currently, I am enhancing my skills through a Data Technician Bootcamp, where I am deepening my knowledge in data processing, analysis, and visualisation. Passionate about using data to drive strategic decisions, I am eager to apply my expertise in a dynamic data role.

    - [GDP (nominal) per Capita](#gdp-nominal)
  GDP (nominal) per Capita <a name="gdp-nominal"></a>
  
  This file allowed me to explore countries IMF estimates, World Bank estimates and UN estimates. Using Python I was able to investigate important information. 
  Image 1 shows me integrating my data as you can see I was looking at the amount of countries per continents. There is slight misinformation as on google Africa has 54, 
  Asia has 48, Europe has 44, North America has 23, South America has 12, and Oceania has 14. There is increase number of countries in my data which were incorrect. 

  Image 2 shows countries which are below the IMF estimates, I had to clean my data before this as a lot of IMF estimate were coming up as NaN which stands for not a 
  number. I replaced this with the value 0f 0 to get more precision.
